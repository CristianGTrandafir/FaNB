# Fitness-and-Nutrition-Buddy

I worked on this project with 3 other people in the Software Engineering II course at UIC.
The main goal was to create a prototypical Android app that would merge the features of standalone nutritional apps and standalone fitness apps, while incorporating realtime data.
The specifications were created by a previous 4 man group in the class, which can be viewed in totality in "Specifications.pdf."
My group's final report detailing our deliverables can be found in "Final Report.pdf."
Our app was coded completely in Java with Android Studio.
